Why Bionic Reading.
Bionic Reading aims to play a supporting role in the absorption
of volume text. We see technological progress as an opportunity
for all those who want to increase the pleasure of reading
in a noisy and hectic world in a focused way and without distraction.

How will this be achieved.
Bionic Reading is a reading system that supports the reading flow.
The eye is guided through the text by means of typographic highlights.
With the interplay of “Fixation” and “Saccade” visual stimuli can be
transferred to the text, which decisively change the typeface.

What does Bionic Reading.
Bionic Reading revises texts so that the most concise parts of words
are highlighted. This guides the eye over the text and the brain
remembers previously learned words more quickly.

Why reading is important.
Reading and text comprehension is essential for active participation
in today’s society. To understand how Bionic Reading works,
we need to understand how reading fundamentally works.

How do we read humans.
When we fixate a part of a word – the fixation – the necessary
information is passed to our brain so that we can match our long-term
memory with the available representational products.

What does it mean.
The jerky phase between fixations is called saccade. During the
saccade jump, we are unable to take in read information and pass it on
to our memory.

What do we want.
With Bionic Reading, we aim to promote reading and comprehension
of textual content in a hectic and noisy world
